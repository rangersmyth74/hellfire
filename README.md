# H3LLCOIN

HellCoins were created in exchange for your sins. :-) 

If you feel like you sinned, then buy a token for forgiveness. All h3llcoins are blessed by the creator and hence solid.

Buy a coin and hold onto it if you have sinned, then that sin is forgiven.

H3LLCOIN's are transactional in nature, as when you die these token coins are transfered in to your spiritual life wallet. 

If you ever get to hell, you can use this token as a pass if you are trully sorry for the sin. One sin per coin. 

The website for the transactions has to be made and I have no idea how to make it. 

So keep checking here until its live!
